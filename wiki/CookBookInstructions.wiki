#summary Get started with the Kettle Cookbook

= Get the cookbook =

You can either download file kettle-cookbook.zip or extract the code from the Subversion source repository.

= Usage =

Kettle Cookbook works by running a standard PDI 4.x job with Kitchen.
Suppose you extracted the Cookbook files in folder: /parking/kettle-cookbook

From your PDI distribution run the job called *pdi/document-all.kjb*, for example like this:

{{{
sh kitchen.sh -file:/parking/kettle-cookbook/pdi/document-all.kjb -param:"INPUT_DIR"=/project/dwh/kettle/ -param:"OUTPUT_DIR"=/tmp/output
}}}

As you can see there are 2 parameters that you can use...

 * *INPUT_DIR* : the location of your source transformations (.ktr) and jobs (.kjb√†
 * *OUTPUT_DIR* : the folder where you want to store the documentation results.

That's all there is to it.

Enjoy the Kettle Cookbook!
