Kettle-cookbook is open source, just like Kettle. And just like Kettle, kettle-cookbook relies on third party open source libraries, without which kettle-cookbook would not have been realized. This page serves to give proper attribution.

== Icons ==
All icons and background images are copied from Kettle (pentaho data integration)

== wz_jsgraphics ==
Hops in the Kettle job and transformation diagrams are drawn using wz_jsgraphics.js. For kettle-cookbook, a small modification was introduced that lets the user set the class name, which allows the lines to be styled using a CSS stylesheet.

== syntaxhighligher ==
Code highlighting is realized using [http://alexgorbatchev.com/SyntaxHighlighter/]
